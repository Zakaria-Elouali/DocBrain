# Calendar Component SCSS Optimization

## Changes Made

### 1. Optimized Calendar.scss

- Replaced direct variable references with map functions
- Used mixins for common styling patterns:
  - `main-area-container` for the main container
  - `flex-between` for space-between layouts
  - `flex-center` for centered layouts
- Removed unnecessary variables for non-color properties (border-radius, padding, etc.)
- Used direct values for properties that don't change between themes
- Maintained CSS variables for color properties that change in dark mode

### 2. Optimized AppointmentList.scss

- Added proper imports for variables and mixins
- Used layout dimension map for sidebar width
- Used mixins for common styling patterns:
  - `flex-column` for column layouts
  - `flex-between` for space-between layouts
  - `flex-center` for centered layouts
- Used CSS variables for color properties that change in dark mode
- Removed hardcoded color values

### 3. Optimized AppointmentModel.scss

- Used mixins for modal styling:
  - `card-style` for the modal content
  - `form-field` for form inputs
  - `button` for buttons with variants
  - `flex-center` for centered layouts
- Removed unnecessary variables for non-color properties
- Used direct values for properties that don't change between themes
- Used z-index map for consistent z-index values
- Used border-radius map for consistent border-radius values

### 4. Optimized Variables in variables-custom.scss

- Removed unnecessary variables for non-color properties:
  - Removed `$calendar-panel-width` (now using layout dimensions map)
  - Removed `$calendar-header-border-radius` (now using border-radius map)
  - Removed `$calendar-grid-border-radius` (now using border-radius map)
  - Removed `$calendar-grid-border` (using direct values)
- Kept only color-related variables that change between themes
- Added clear comments to indicate purpose of variables

### 5. Optimized Variables in variables-dark.scss

- Only included variables that actually change from light mode
- Removed duplicate variables that have the same values in both themes
- Removed unnecessary variables for non-color properties
- Added clear comments to indicate which variables are being overridden

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Duplication

- Removed redundant variables that don't change between themes
- Used mixins for common styling patterns
- Used map functions to reference values from design tokens

### 2. Improved Maintainability

- Clear organization of variables by purpose
- Consistent use of mixins across components
- Direct values for properties that don't change between themes
- CSS variables only for properties that change between themes

### 3. Better Theme Switching

- Only necessary variables included in dark mode
- Consistent approach to theme-dependent styling
- Clear separation between structural and theme-dependent properties

### 4. Enhanced Developer Experience

- Easier to find and modify variables
- Clearer relationship between variables and their usage
- Mixins reduce the amount of code needed for common patterns

### 5. Performance Improvements

- Fewer variables to process
- More efficient SCSS structure
- Reduced file sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Similar Optimizations to Other Components**
   - Use the same approach for other components
   - Ensure consistent use of mixins across the codebase

2. **Further Consolidate Global Variables**
   - Identify and remove more unused variables
   - Further consolidate duplicate styling

3. **Create Component-Specific Mixins**
   - Create mixins for component-specific styling patterns
   - Ensure consistent styling across related components
